# CrowdCoin  
It is a crowd funding application based on "Blockchain Technology".  
"Smart Contract" is the core of this application.  
It is designed for students who have project ideas but doesn't have enough funds.  
  
## Working :-  
1]"Idea Person" can create a campaign. He can set some minimum contribution for his campaign.  
2]One who creates a campaign, becomes 'manager' of the campaign.  
3]Other users can donate money to his campaign. User who contributes becomes 'approvers' of the campaign.    
4]Whenever 'manager' want to use money from the 'campaign', he is required to create a "Spending Request".      
5]In this request he will specify the reason for spending money, amount of money he wants to spend and to whom he want to pay the amount.    
6]When this request gets approval from more than 50% of 'approvers' only then 'manager' can fanalize the request.  
7]After 'manager' finalizes the request, money will be sent to the address which is specified in the request itself.  
  
## Advantage :-  
1]There are malicious people who have no intent to create a project or startup.  
2]They just creates campaigns on such crowdfunding applications and misuses the money.  
3]Here they can't do so.  
4]Even they are successful in creating a campaingn and raising funds by faking project ideas, they will not be able to spend it.  
5]As spending request requires approvals, if contributers observes some suspicious activity, they will not approve his request.  
6]Here contributers have total control over the money they can see were the money is going and can see weather the recipient is geniune or not.
